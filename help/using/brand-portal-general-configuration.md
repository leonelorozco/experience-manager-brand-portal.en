# Administer general tenant configurations {#administer-general-tenant-configurations}

Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal allows organizations to configure the following capabilities for specific tenants:

* Asset deletion by administrators
* Public collection creation by non-admin users
* Public smart collection creation by non-admin users
* The parent hierarchy of shared folders is visible to non-admin users

These configurations have been provided as **[!UICONTROL General Settings]** configurations in the administrative tools panel.

**A** - Configuration to let administrators delete assets from Brand Portal. (Default is enabled)

**B** - Configuration to let non-admin users create public collections. (Default is enabled)

**C** - Configuration to let non-admin users create public smart collections. (Default is enabled)

**D** - Configuration to display the folder hierarchy (from the root) of shared folders to non-admin users (Editors, Viewers, Guest Users). (Default is disabled)
