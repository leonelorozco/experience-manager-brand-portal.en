# Overview of Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal {#overview-of-aem-assets-brand-portal}

As a marketer, you sometimes need to collaborate with channel partners and internal business users to create, manage, and quickly deliver relevant digital content to customers. Timely delivery of relevant content across the entire customer journey is critical to driving greater demand, conversion, engagement, and customer loyalty.

However, developing solutions that support efficient and secure sharing of such things as approved brand logos, campaign assets, or product shots with teams, partners, and resellers are challenging. Ensuring both efficiency and security in this process requires careful planning and execution.

**Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets Brand Portal** focuses on the marketer's need to collaborate effectively with the globally distributed Brand Portal users by providing asset distribution and asset contribution capabilities.

Asset distribution lets you acquire, control, and securely distribute approved creative assets to external parties and internal business users across devices. However, Asset contribution enables the Brand Portal users with the ability to upload assets to Brand Portal and publish to Experience Manager Assets, without needing access to the author environment. The contribution feature is called as **Assets Sourcing in Brand Portal**. And together, it improves the overall Brand Portal experience of asset distribution and contribution from the Brand Portal users (external agencies/teams), accelerates the time-to-market for assets, and reduces the risk of non-compliance and unauthorized access.
See, [Asset Sourcing in Brand Portal](brand-portal-asset-sourcing.md).

The browser-based portal environment enables you to upload, browse, search, preview, and export assets easily in approved formats.

## Configure Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal {#configure-brand-portal}

Configuring Adobe Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal enables asset publishing, asset distribution, and asset contribution features for the Brand Portal users. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>Configuring Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal is supported on Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service, Experience Manager Assets 6.3 and above.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> * Brand Portal is in maintenance mode. All new product innovations are available on [Content Hub](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/content-hub/product-overview).
> * If you still need to activate Brand Portal, contact your Adobe representative with details of your use case and other specific requirements.
> * Brand Portal is not available with [Assets Prime](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-prime) or [Assets Ultimate](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/assets-ultimate-overview). However, existing Assets as a Cloud Service customers who already have access to Brand Portal can continue to use it when they transition to Assets Ultimate.

<!--Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service is automatically configured with Brand Portal by activating Brand Portal from the Cloud Manager. The activation workflow creates the required configurations at the backend and activates Brand Portal on the same IMS org as of the Experience Manager Assets as a Cloud Service instance.-->

However, Experience Manager Assets (on premise and managed services) is manually configured with Brand Portal using Adobe Developer Console, which procures an Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) token for authorization of the Brand Portal tenant. 

For more information, see [configuring Experience Manager Assets with Brand Portal](../using/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.md).

### Guest user {#guest-user}

Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal allows [guest access](#request-access-to-brand-portal) to Brand Portal. A guest user does not need credentials to enter the portal and has access to the public folders and collections. As a guest user, you can browse through asset details and have a full asset view of members of public folders and collections. You can search, download, and add public assets to the [!UICONTROL Lightbox] collection.

However, the guest session restricts you from creating collections and saved searches, and shares them further. Users in a guest session can neither access folder and collections settings nor share assets as link. Here is a list of tasks that a guest user can perform:

* [Browse and access public assets](browse-assets-brand-portal.md)

* [Search public assets](brand-portal-searching.md)

* [Download public assets](brand-portal-download-assets.md)

* [Add assets to [!UICONTROL Lightbox]](brand-portal-light-box.md#add-assets-to-lightbox)

For more information, go to [Guest Access to Brand Portal](../using/guest-access.md). 

### Viewer {#viewer}

Brand Portal user defined in the [!DNL Admin Console] who has access to Brand Portal with the role of Viewer. A user with this role can log in to Brand Portal and access permitted folders, collections, and assets. The user can also browse, preview, download, and export assets (original or specific renditions), configure account settings, and search for assets. Here is a list of tasks that a Viewer can perform:

* [Browse assets](browse-assets-brand-portal.md)

* [Search for assets](brand-portal-searching.md)

* [Download assets](brand-portal-download-assets.md)

### Editor {#editor}

A user with the role of Editor can perform all tasks that a Viewer can perform. In addition, an Editor can view the files and folders that an administrator shares. The user with the role of an Editor can also share content (files, folders, collections) with others.

Apart from the tasks that a Viewer can perform, an Editor can perform the following additional tasks:

* [Share folders](brand-portal-sharing-folders.md)

* [Share a collection](brand-portal-share-collection.md)

* [Share assets as a link](brand-portal-link-share.md)

### Administrator {#administrator}

An administrator includes a user marked as system administrator or Brand Portal product administrator in the [!UICONTROL Admin Console]. An administrator can add and remove system administrators and users, define presets, send email to users, and view portal usage and storage reports.

>[!NOTE]
>
>In Brand Portal, a user marked with the role of support administrator in the [!UICONTROL Admin Console] has the same privileges as a system administrator does.

An administrator can perform all tasks that an Editor can perform. The following are the additional tasks that an administrator can perform:

* [Manage users, groups, and user roles](brand-portal-adding-users.md)
* [Customize wallpaper, page headers, and emails](brand-portal-branding.md)
* [Use custom search facets](brand-portal-search-facets.md)
* [Use metadata schema](brand-portal-metadata-schemas.md)
* [Apply image presets or dynamic renditions](brand-portal-image-presets.md)
* [Work with reports](brand-portal-reports.md)

In addition to the above tasks, an Author in AEM Assets can perform the following tasks:

* [Configure AEM Assets with Brand Portal](../using/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.md)
* [Publish folders to Brand Portal](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/assets/brandportal/brand-portal-publish-folder)
* [Publish collections to Brand Portal](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/assets/brandportal/brand-portal-publish-collection)

## Alternate alias for Brand Portal url {#tenant-alias-for-portal-url}

Brand Portal 6.4.3 onwards, organizations can have one alternate (alias) URL for each existing URL of their Brand Portal tenant. The alias URL can be created by having an alternate prefix in the URL.  
If the tenant name is greater than 32 characters, then a tenant alias needs to be created.
Note that only the prefix of the Brand Portal URL can be customized and not the entire URL. For example, an organization with existing domain `geomettrix.brand-portal.adobe.com` can get `geomettrixinc.brand-portal.adobe.com` created on request.

However, the AEM Author instance can be [configured](../using/configure-aem-assets-with-brand-portal.md) only with the tenant id URL and not with the tenant alias (alternate) URL.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To obtain an alias for the tenant name in an existing portal URL, organizations need to contact Customer Support with a new tenant alias creation request. First, check if the alias is available, then create the alias to process this request.
>
>To replace or delete the old alias, the same process needs to be followed.

## Request access to Brand Portal {#request-access-to-brand-portal}
