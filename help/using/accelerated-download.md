# Speed up the Brand Portal downloads {#guide-to-accelerate-downloads-from-brand-portal}

<!-- This topic is woefully out of date. It talks at length about using a third party application whose URLs have a variety of problems. Topic should either be deleted or updated entirely to not talk about a specific third party application that Adobe has no control over. It also appears that the third party app is NOT free anymore. -->

Adobe Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal allows enhancing the download performance of large asset files by integrating with IBM&reg; Aspera Connect, which is an install-on-demand application. The application uses proprietary technology to remove TCP overheads and helps improve the transfer speed of the asset files. This integration ensures an enhanced download experience.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Download speed varies for users because it depends on factors such as network bandwidth, server latency, and the geographical location of clients.

The **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** configuration is by default enabled, which significantly reduces the time taken to download the desired asset files from Brand Portal.

![](assets/download-settings-new.png)

## Prerequisites to accelerate file download {#prerequisites-to-accelerate-file-download}

To download the files faster, ensure the following:

* Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Tools]** > **[!UICONTROL Download]** and verify that the **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** configuration is enabled in **[!UICONTROL Download Settings]**.
* Ensure that port 33001 (both TCP and UDP) is open on the firewall.
* **Install IBM&reg; Aspera Connect 3.9.9** in your browser's extension using administrator privileges ([IBM&reg; Aspera Connect Downloads](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7EOther%20software&product=ibm/Other+software/IBM+Aspera+Connect&release=3.9.9&platform=All&function=all)).

>[!NOTE]
>
>There is a known issue with IBM&reg; Aspera Connect. Fast download does not work with IBM&reg; Aspera Connect version 3.10 and above.

## Download domains {#download-domains}

Following are the download domains for different geographies:

| Region Code |Domain |
|---|---|

   ![download-dialog](assets/download-dialog-box-new.png)

1. By default the **[!UICONTROL Fast Download]** setting is enabled in the **[!UICONTROL Download Settings]**. Therefore, a confirmation box appears to download assets using IBM&reg; Aspera Connect. 
   
   If you downloaded assets for the first time and do not have IBM&reg; Aspera Connect installed in your browser, you are prompted to install it. If the existing version is out-of-date, you are also prompted to install the [Aspera download accelerator](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm%7EOther%20software&product=ibm/Other+software/IBM+Aspera+Connect&release=3.9.9&platform=All&function=all).

   ![](assets/aspera-not-launched.png)

## Using file accelerator on Microsoft&reg; Edge browser {#using-file-accelerator-on-microsoft-edge-browser}

Microsoft&reg; Edge runs in Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) preventing communication with the Aspera Connect server, while on the same private network or with a Trusted Site. Therefore, a pop- up shows up every time a connection with the server is being established.

![](assets/switchapps-msedge.png)

To use accelerated download functionality on Microsoft&reg; Edge, remove the Brand Portal site from the Trusted Site list.

1. Open the Control Panel (**[!UICONTROL Window key + X]**, then select **[!UICONTROL Control Panel]**).
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Network and Internet]** > **[!UICONTROL Internet Options]**. Click the **[!UICONTROL Security]** tab.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Trusted sites zone]**, then click **[!UICONTROL Sites]**.
1. Remove the Brand Portal site from the list.

## Aspera Connect client Preferences {#aspera-connect-client-preferences}

There are a few useful preferences that can be set in IBM&reg; Aspera Connect client preference by right-clicking the icon and selecting **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.

![](assets/download_assets_frombrandportalimg19.png)

You can set the default download location.

![](assets/aspera-preferences.png)

Also, the Aspera Connect client can be marked so that it automatically starts on system startup. And, the Connect client runs and is available for the download to begin faster.

![](assets/aspera-automaticallylaunch.png) 

## Troubleshoot issues with download acceleration {#troubleshoot-issues-with-download-acceleration}

If download acceleration is not working for you, try the following suggestions:

1. Check that ports are not blocked. Use Google Search to find options that let you check if ports are blocked, based on the operating system that is used.  <!-- THIS URL IS 404 AND DOES NOT REDIRECT [https://test-connect.asperasoft.com](https://test-connect.asperasoft.com/) from your computer. -->

   If ports are not OK, then reach out to your network team and ensure that Ports 33001 (both TCP & UDP) are not blocked in the firewall.

1. If the ports are OK, then check if your network is not slow by measuring the available bandwidth using [https://www.speedtest.net/](https://www.speedtest.net/).

   If the bandwidth is a few (1-10 Mbps) or in Kbps, then use Aspera Preferences and try to limit the bandwidth equal to the available bandwidth.

   <!-- 
   The URL in this step is giving a 404 error. 1. To confirm whether the downloads from Aspera demo server are working, use [https://demo.asperasoft.com/aspera/user](https://demo.asperasoft.com/aspera/user).  
   (login:  asperaweb , password:  demoaspera ) 
   -->

1. If none of the above troubleshooting steps work, deselect the option Enable Download Acceleration and use the normal download.
