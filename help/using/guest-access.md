# Guest Access to Brand Portal {#guest-access-to-brand-portal}

Experience Manager Assets Brand Portal allows guest access to the portal. A guest user does not need credentials to enter the portal and has access to the public assets (and collections) of the portal. Users in the guest session can add assets to lightbox (private collection) and download the same until their session lasts or unless the guest user chooses to [[!UICONTROL End Session]](#exit-guest-session). A guest user session remains active for 15 minutes.

Guest access functionality enables organizations to [share approved assets quickly](../using/brand-portal-sharing-folders.md#how-to-share-folders) with the intended audience at scale without having to onboard them. Brand Portal 6.4.2 onwards is equipped to serve multiple concurrent guest users, which is 10% of the total user quota per organization. Allowing guest access saves time to manage and on-board scores of users with limited functionalities on Brand Portal.  
Organizations can enable (or disable) guest access on the Brand Portal account of the organization using the **[!UICONTROL Allow Guest Access]** option from the **[!UICONTROL Access]** settings in the administrative tools panel.

## Begin guest session {#begin-guest-session}

To enter Brand Portal anonymously, select **[!UICONTROL Click here]** corresponding to **[!UICONTROL `Guest Access?`]** on Brand Portal's welcome screen. Enter the captcha security check to grant access to use the Brand Portal.

![](assets/bp-login-screen.png) 

## Guest session duration {#guest-session-duration}

A guest user session remains active for 15 minutes. 
This process preserves the state of the **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** for 15 minutes from the session start time. After that, the current guest session restarts, causing the Lightbox state to be lost.

For example, a guest user logs in to Brand Portal at 1500 hours and adds assets to **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** for download at 15:05 hours. If the user does not download the **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** collection (or its assets) before 15:15 hours (within 15 minutes of signing in), the user has to restart the session. The **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** is empty, which means the uploaded assets are no longer available if the session was lost.

## Concurrent guest sessions allowed {#concurrent-guest-sessions-allowed}

The number of concurrent guest sessions is limited to 10% of the total user quota per organization. It means that for an organization that has a user quota of 200, a maximum of 20 guest users can work at the same time. The 21st user is denied access, and can access as a guest only if the session of any of the 20 active guest users ends.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Brand Portal does not send notification if the number of licensed users exceeds the contracted value (quota). Also, it does not restrict any activity of the licensed users. 

## Guest user interaction with Brand Portal {#guest-user-interaction-with-brand-portal}

### Guest UI Navigation

On entering the Brand Portal as the guest, users can see all the [assets and folders shared](../using/brand-portal-sharing-folders.md#sharefolders) publicly or with guest users exclusively. This view is the content only view, which displays assets in either of the card, list, or column layouts.

![](assets/disabled-folder-hierarchy1.png)


If administrators enable [Enable Folder Hierarchy](../using/brand-portal-general-configuration.md#main-pars-header-1621071021), guest users see the folder tree from the root and shared folders within their parent folders upon logging into the Brand Portal.

These parent folders are virtual folders and no actions can be performed on them. You can recognize these virtual folders with a lock icon.

No action tasks are visible on hovering or selecting them in **[!UICONTROL Card View]**, unlike the shared folders. The **[!UICONTROL Overview]** button is shown on selecting a virtual folder in **[!UICONTROL Column View]** and **[!UICONTROL List View]**.

>[!NOTE]

>The default thumbnail of the virtual folders is the thumbnail image of the first shared folder.

![](assets/enabled-hierarchy1.png) ![](assets/hierarchy1-nonadmin.png) ![](assets/hierarchy-nonadmin.png) ![](assets/hierarchy2-nonadmin.png)

The **[!UICONTROL View Settings]** option allows the guest users to adjust card sizes in **[!UICONTROL Card View]** or columns to display in **[!UICONTROL List View]**.

![](assets/nav-guest-user.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Content tree]** lets you move through the assets hierarchy.

![](assets/guest-login-ui.png)

Brand Portal provides an **[!UICONTROL Overview]** option for guest users to view **[!UICONTROL Asset Properties]** of selected assets/folders. The **[!UICONTROL Overview]** option is visible:

* In the toolbar, at the top, on selecting an asset or folder.
* In the drop-down on selecting the Rail Selector.

When you select the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** option while an asset or folder is selected, users can see the title, path, and time of asset creation. Whereas on the asset detail page, selecting the **[!UICONTROL Overview]** option lets the users see metadata of the asset.

![](assets/overview-option-1.png)

![](assets/overview-rail-selector-1.png)

The **[!UICONTROL Navigation]** option in the left rail allows navigating from files to collections and back in the guest session so that users can browse through assets in files or collections.

The **[!UICONTROL Filter]** option lets guest users filter asset files and folders using search predicates set by the administrator.

### Guest user capabilities

Guest users can access public assets on Brand Portal, and also have few restrictions as discussed further.

**Guest users can**:

* Access all the public folders and collections meant for all the Brand Portal users.
* Browse members, detail page, and have a full asset view of the members of all the public folders and collections.
* Search assets across public folders and collections.
* Add assets to lightbox collection. These changes to the collection persist during the session.
* Download assets directly or through lightbox collection.

**Guest users cannot**:

* Create collections and saved searches, or share them further.
* Access folder and collections settings.
* Share assets as links.

### Download assets in guest session

Guest users can directly download assets shared publically or exclusively with guest users on Brand Portal. Guest users can also add assets to **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** (public collection), and download the **[!UICONTROL Lightbox]** collection before their session expires.

To download assets and collections, use the download icon from:

* Quick action thumbnails, which appear on hovering over the asset or collection
* The toolbar at the top, which appears on selecting the asset or collection

![](assets/download-on-guest.png)

Selecting **[!UICONTROL Enable download acceleration]** in the [!UICONTROL Download] dialog box lets you [enhance the download performance](../using/accelerated-download.md).

## Exit guest session {#exit-guest-session}

To exit a guest session, use **[!UICONTROL End Session]** from the options available in the header. However, if the browser tab-used for the guest session-is inactive then the session automatically expires after two hours of inactivity.

![](assets/end-guest-session.png)

## Monitoring guest user activities {#monitoring-guest-user-activities}

Administrators can monitor guest user interaction with the Brand Portal. Reports generated in Brand Portal can provide key insights into guest user activities. For example, the **[!UICONTROL Download]** report can be used to track the count of assets downloaded by the guest user. **[!UICONTROL User Logins]** report can inform when the guest user last logged in to the portal and the frequency of logins in a specified duration.
